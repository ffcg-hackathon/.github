# FFCG Hackathon, a free github organisation (we pay for build-minutes)

Everything in this organization is managed by Terraform and ffcg-labs-as-code repo.

How to create your own gcp environment:

1. Pull down the ffcg-labs-as-code repo.
2. Go to metadata/ directory 
3. Create a yaml file for you (you can also add other members), your group and your environment.
4. Create a branch
5. Commit your changes & submit a Pull-request.

After that you wait on approval. Once approved the engines will start to huff and puff and hopefully with in a minute or two you will get a terraform repository that you can use to deploy google cloud infrastructure.

How to work in terraform is a lesson on its own but you can always ask.
